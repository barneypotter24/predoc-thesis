\section{Online Bayesian phylogenetic inference}

We have demonstrated the utility of Bayesian phylogenetic inference as a tool for performing rigorous \textit{post hoc} analysis of viral pathogen outbreaks, however much work remains for

\section{Database integration}

One of the most crucial next steps that we identify moving forward towards the ideal online Bayesian phylogenetic framework is the development of tools to seamlessly integrate data streams with analysis pipelines.
In particular, we suggest the combination of BEAST's analysis tools with genomic databases whose design is focused around efficient, biologically informed storage of both genetic sequence data, as well as relevant metadata.
This integration would considerably mitigate the amount of bespoke preprocessing work that is currently required to get phylogenetic builds running \barneycomment{this sounds dumb, reword}.
Such ``full stack" pipelines are currently in existence for Maximum Likelihood bases phylogenetics\cite{nextstrain}, however at this time no such framework exists for large-scale Bayesian phylogenetic analysis.

As our next direction, we will integrate existing online BEAST pipelines with GLUE\cite{glue}---a database software designed specifically for viral genomic sequence data.
