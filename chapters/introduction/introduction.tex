\section{Phylogenetics}

\cite{FrRo2010Diffusion}

\section{Bayesian statistics}

\section{Bayesian phylodynamics and joint inference}

Bayesian statistics and MCMC are good for phylogenies.
We can gibbs sample anything.. idk..


\section{Viral pathogens}

Viral pathogens are a particularly useful study system for Bayesian phylogeneticists because their small genomes and fast evolutionary rate facilitate both tractable computation and a constant stream of constantly evolving genomes.
Addditionally, viruses frequently cause human suffering and death, both as endemic diseases (seasonal influenza, hepatitis, etc.) and the agents behind sudden disease epidemics (Zika, Ebola, Lassa).
Indeed, viruses have been responsible for the majority of the most deadly pandemics of the last century (Spanish influenza, tons of other flu pandemics, Covid).
Like, do I really need to convince you, dear reader?
The whole world has been locked in their houses for the last two months for gods sake.
