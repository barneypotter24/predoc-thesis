\section{HBV phylogeography}

We performed phylogeographic inference on a dataset consisting of contemporary sequences given to us by collaborators and available from public databases, as well as a set of recently published ancient \gls{hbv} genomes.
The resulting dataset comprised 583 sequences of \gls{hbv}-A genotype viruses, 764 sequences of \gls{hbv}-D sequences, and 234 sequences of \gls{hbv}-E genotype viruses.
With the inclusion of ancient genomes, the final \gls{hbv}-A and \gls{hbv}-D datasets included 587 and 769 total taxa, respectively.

\subsection{Demographic reconstruction}

For this project, we had originally planned to reconstruct the demographic history of hepatitis B genotypes throughout their history using a Bayesian skygrid coalescent model.
This was a process by which we divided the evolutionary history of the virus into discrete intervals, then attempted to treat each resulting ``bin'' as a constant population size time window---yielding a population function over time that was piecewise constant.
Bins would then be smoothed with their neighboring bins to make a continuous estimation of population size through time.

Unfortunately, this process proved unsuccessful.
The initial cause of the lack of success was found to lie within Gaussian Markov Random Field ``block'' transition kernel of the \gls{mcmc} that governed the change in the population size values for the skygrid model.
This operator became ``stuck'' in all cases where we attempted to use it, such that the \gls{mcmc} algorithm would never accept new proposals for the population sizes which led to the entire Markov chain became stuck in a local optimum and was never able to leave it.
We attempted to rectify this situation by changing to a different transition kernel---a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo operator---however this operator was not able to explore the state space rapidly enough to produce results

To circumvent these issues, we transitioned to using a less sophisticated demographic model wherein the entire population size was assumed to be constant throughout history.
Using this method, we recovered that \gls{hbv}-A had an inferred effective population size of 1,620 [95\% HPD:765--2,815] and that \gls{hbv}-D had an inferred effective population size of 60,686 [95\% HPD: 38,478--86,598].

\subsection{Temporal signal and evolutionary rates}

The mean evolutionary rate and times to the most recent common ancestor (\gls{tmrca}) were first estimated for all datasets without including any ancient sequences (and hence not imposed any informative prior information) by collaborators.
\gls{hbv} genotype A was estimated to evolve at a mean rate of $5.75\times10^{-4}$ [95\% HPD: $3.81\times10^{-4}$--$7.90\times10^{-4}$] substitutions/site/year, genotype D at a mean rate of $1.27\times10^{-3}$ [95\% HPD: $1.12\times10^{-3}$--$1.43\times10^{-3}$] substitutions/site/year, and genotype E at a mean rate of $6.84\times10^{-4}$ [95\% HPD: $2.08\times10^{-4}$--$1.16\times10^{-3}$] substitutions/site/year.
However, \gls{hbv} often shows very little temporal signal, making it difficult to accurately estimate the time scale for an \gls{hbv} phylogeny and to hence put accurate dates on historical migrations of the virus.
M{\"u}hlemann et al. (2018) have shown that including ancient genomic sequences can provide the required additional information to warrant the use of molecular clock models to reconstruct time-measured phylogenetic trees for \gls{hbv}.
For \gls{hbv} datasets A and D, we have hence included the relevant ancient sequences and have set an informative prior distribution on the mean of the underlying lognormal distribution for the uncorrelated relaxed clock model, based on the reported estimate from M{\"u}hlemann et al. (2018).
For genotype A, this leads us to obtain a somewhat increased mean rate of $7.32\times10^{-4}$ [95\% HPD: $4.14\times10^{-4}$--$1.06\times10^{-3}$] substitutions/site/year, while for genotype D we obtained a much decreased mean rate of $9.65\times10^{-5}$ [95\% HPD: $5.97\times10^{-5}$--$1.36\times10^{-4}$] substitutions/site/year.
We did not generate an updated estimate for the evolutionary rate of genotype E, as no ancient genomes were available to inform such an inference.
\subsection{Phylogenetic placement}

An initial goal of ours was to phylogenetically place the 118 newly sequenced genomes (split among \gls{hbv} genotypes A, D, and E), which were provided to us by collaborators, into discrete subgenotype-level categories.
This was done by performing phylogenetic inference on the full set of genomes and then locating the new sequences within the context of preexisting genetic diversity for their respective genotypes.
Using this method, we were able to infer putative subgenotypes for each new sequence.
For the genotypes that we analyzed, 54 belong to \gls{hbv} genotypes A and D---the only genotypes we consider for which subgenotype definitions exist.
The remaining 64 new sequences that we introduce come from \gls{hbv}-E; we find that these novel genomes span the existing known diversity of the genotype (Fig.~\ref{fig:HBV-E_new_sequences}).

The most frequent \gls{hbv}-A subgenotypes (Fig.~\ref{fig:HBV-A_new_sequences}) identified were A1 (n = 27, 57.4\%), quasi-subgenotype A3 (n = 11, 23.4\%) including previous [A3(n = 5, 10.6\%), A4 (n = 4, 8.6\%) and A5 (n = 2, 4.3\%)], and A6 (n = 4, 8.6\%).
Interestingly, phylogenies revealed that two African isolates (ID: MB-135 and MB-146) belonging to \gls{hbv} genotype A did not cluster with any of the known subgenotypes.
Our analysis also revealed that some \gls{hbv}-A sequences with a previously identified subgenotype do not cluster phylogenetically with other members of their subgenotype.
These inconsistencies manifested themselves as three sequences identified as A1, falling independently within the A2 subgenotype.
We also found a single sequence A2 sequence that clusters phylogenetically within A1.

Interestingly, a similar situation was observed in the phylogenetic tree of genotype D strains of this study.
While 6 out of 8 \gls{hbv} genotype D isolates (Fig.~\ref{fig:HBV-D_new_sequences}) were phylogenetically classified as subgenotypes D1 (n = 4, 57.1\%), D2 (n = 2, 28.6\%) and D7 (n = 1, 14.3\%), two strains (ID: MB-46 and MB-96) did not cluster with any of the \gls{hbv} subgenotype D1-D9 references sequences.

\subsection{Migration history}

\subsubsection{Genotype A}

We performed discrete phylogeographic reconstruction for \gls{hbv} genotype A with the inclusion of the relevant ancient genomic sequences (Fig.~\ref{fig:HBV-A_phylogeo}).
We estimated the most recent common ancestor (\gls{mrca}) of of \gls{hbv}-A to have been located in East \& South Asia circa 2504 BCE.
From there, we inferred that genotype A spread to Europe around 2000 BCE, then to Africa between 500 and 1500 CE.
Following the jump to Africa, the topology of trees generated both with and without ancient genomes is well conserved.
Notably, we observed at least 5 different introductions from Africa to the Americas taking place after the year 1700, consistent with the timing of the Atlantic slave trade.
Following 1900, we observed a marked increase in the number of geographic jumps between the Americas, Europe, and West \& Central Asia; this is consistent with the rapid globalization that took place during the previous century.
The more recent introduction into West \& Central Asia occurred from both Europe and the Americas from the 1960s onward.
Finally, we noted that in the most recent half-century there is little inferred migration, suggesting a strong recent geographic clade effect.

\subsubsection{Genotype D}

As with genotype A, we estimated the evolutionary and migration history of \gls{hbv}-D (Fig.~\ref{fig:HBV-D_phylogeo}), and included ancient genomes to provide temporal signal to the dataset.
The \gls{mrca} that we inferred was located in East \& South Asia around 1779 BCE.
We observed an immediate jump out of the root location to West \& Central Asia, and we observed most of the evolutionary history of genotype to take place between West \& Central and East \& South Asia.
Following its time in East \& South Asia, we observed multiple introductions into Africa, the Americas, and Europe.
We also noted that the majority of introductions into the Americas were spawned from Europe.

Unlike with genotype A, we saw that there is a noticeable discrepancy between phylogenetic reconstructions with and without the inclusion of ancient genomes.
As discussed in the previous section, the inclusion of ancient genomes yielded a much lower evolutionary rate estimate in \gls{hbv}-D, however we also found that clade divergence times were substantially older in the dataset that included ancient sequences.
Our \gls{tmrca} estimates of the largest predominantly African lineage suggest their most recent shared ancestor existed circa 550 CE, while the \gls{tmrca} of a mixed European/Americas clade is estimated around 1100 CE.
As with genotype A, individual clades showed a strong local geographic effect, with few individual location changes occurring within the most recent 50 years.

\subsubsection{Genotype E}

We finally performed phylogeographic reconstruction of \gls{hbv} genotype E (Fig.~\ref{fig:HBV-E_phylogeo}).
This genotype had no available ancient genomes, and was comprised of mostly sequences from African countries.
We estimated the \gls{mrca} of this genotype to be in Africa circa 1825 CE.
From Africa, we inferred migrations into Europe and the Americas.
Given that nearly all European sequences in the estimated phylogeny are singletons, there is not enough statistical support to estimate the timing of these migrations accurately.

\subsubsection{Migration history support}

To confirm that our inferred migration histories were valid, we performed two tests to ensure that our inferred results were statistically supported.
We first summarized the strongest supported rates of discrete location transitions between pairs of regions for each genotype dataset using Bayes factor analysis (Fig.~\ref{fig:bayes_factors}).
For \gls{hbv}-A, we found very strong (i.e. Bayes factor $>100$) support for movements from Europe to East \& South Asia and the Americas, as well as strong support for movements from the Americas and Africa to Europe (Fig.~\ref{fig:bayes_factors}).
However, we did not find support for movements between West \& Central Asia and the Americas, nor for movements between West \& Central Asia and East \& South Asia, nor between Africa and East \& South Asia.
For \gls{hbv}-D, we observed very strong support for outgoing movements from West \& Central Asia to Europe, Africa and East \& South Asia.
We also found very strong support for outgoing movements from Europe to East \& South Asia, West \& Central Asia and the Americas.
However, we did not find support for movements between West \& Central Asia and the Americas, nor between Africa and the Americas.
Finally, for \gls{hbv}-E, we only found very strong support for movements from Africa into Europe and strong support for movements from Africa to the Americas.
We confirmed the estimated number of geographic transitions by counting Markov jumps on each posterior tree.
The average of counted jumps between each region agreed with the values counted on the \gls{mcc} trees that we present.
This agreement is indicative that the trees that we show are representative of the posterior tree distribution in terms of migration history.

\section{LASV phylogenetics}

For all LASV analyses we present preliminary results which will motivate future work.
Using our adaptive workflow, we performed Bayesian phylogenetic inference on \gls{lasv} segments L and S under a Bayesian skygrid demographic model.
We ran \gls{mcmc} chains for segment L in parallel for a combined total of $1.5\times10^{12}$ states (excluding burn-in), and S for a combined total of $2.4\times10^{12}$ states (excluding burn-in).
We note that this analysis took almost a month of computational time on the cluster of the Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum, Flanders' most highly integrated high-performance research computing environment, parallelized across three independent replicates per segment.
This represents a total computational time of roughly 6 months.

Our inference revealed markedly different evolutionary rates between the two segments.
In segment L we inferred a mean evolutionary rate of $9.9914\times10^{-4}$ substitutions/site/year [95\% HPD:$9.0332\times10^{-4}$--$1.0646\times10^{-3}$].
In segment S we instead inferred a mean evolutionary rate of $2.2116\times10^{-3}$ substitutions/site/year [95\% HPD:$1.9757\times10^{-3}$--$2.4948\times10^{-3}$].
While this estimate for the evolutionary rate of segment L is concordant with rates established for \gls{lasv} in the literature \cite{andersen2015clinical, fichet2016spatial}, our estimate for segment S differed from the literature by a factor of 10 (Fig.~\ref{fig:lassa_clock_rates}).
Despite this difference, we found overlapping estimates of \gls{tmrca} for the two segments: 1698 CE for segment L and 1752 CE for segment S.
Additionally, we performed Bayesian skygrid reconstruction of the demographic history of both segment L (Fig.~\ref{fig:l_skygrid}) and segment S (Fig.~\ref{fig:s_skygrid}).
Both segments' population size trajectories over time showed the same patterns.
In both segments we observed exponentially increasing effective population size since the \gls{tmrca} until roughly 1900.
The 1900s showed a trough in effective population size (lowest around the year 1950) followed by another increase in population until roughly the 1990s.
Over the last three decades, we observed much more variable growth and decline in population size, with sharp dips in inferred population size in the late 1990s and since the year 2015.

While segment L's evolutionary rate falls within the expected window, segment S demonstrates an evolutionary rate roughly tenfold higher than expected.}
